    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    
    <p> I am a Mexican American digital media artist currently
      studying at San Jose State University.
    </p>

    <p> Art is supposed to evoke a reaction from someone whether it be 
    physical or emotional, therefore that is what I aim to do with my art. 
    Through pastel colors and a playful art style my work tries to evoke 
    an eye-catching physical response from the audience while also 
    targeting serious topics that would catch the emotions of the viewer. 
    I mainly focus on mental health, Mexican culture, queer representation, 
    and fanart in my compositions. My art mainly consist of digital 
     creations such as animations, animatics, digital art, and video games. 
    However, I do dabble with studio art and once in a while will produce 
    paintings and physical drawings.
  </p>

  <p>
  Digital art shapes my work because it 
    was the first thing that inspired me to go down the path of being an 
    artist. However, physical art helped me improve significantly as an 
    artist. I hope viewers are able to see that even with a cute 
    simplistic style you can be considered a serious art who tackles 
    important topics.
